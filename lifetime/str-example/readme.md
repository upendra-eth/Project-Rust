# add life time in &str 

struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: &str,
    email: &str,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}

fn main() {
    let user1 = User {
        active: true,
        username: "someusername123",
        email: "someone@example.com",
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
}

The compiler will complain that it needs lifetime specifiers:



This code will not compile in Rust because the User struct is defined with references to string slices &str for the username and email fields. This means that the User struct is borrowing the string data from another source, but it does not specify where the data is coming from. Rust requires that all references must have a known lifetime, which specifies how long the borrowed data will be valid.

To fix this issue, we need to add lifetime annotations to the struct definition to specify the lifetime of the references. Here's an example:

rust
Copy code
struct User<'a> {
    active: bool,
    username: &'a str,
    email: &'a str,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}

fn main() {
    let user1 = User {
        active: true,
        username: "someusername123",
        email: "someone@example.com",
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
}
In this example, we've added a lifetime annotation 'a to the struct definition, which indicates that the lifetime of the references in the User struct must be tied to some other lifetime. In this case, we are tying the lifetime of the references to the lifetime of the struct itself, which means that the borrowed data will be valid for as long as the User instance is valid.

By adding lifetime annotations to the struct definition, we can now compile the code successfully and create instances of the User struct with string slice references for the username and email fields.
