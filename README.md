# Project-Rust

Hello there, my fellow coders!

This is where I've put all the code from my Hindi YouTube videos, so you can find it all in one place. It's like a collection of cool coding stuff for you to play with.

I've sorted the code by video, so you can find the code that goes with each video in its own folder. Inside each folder, you'll find all the code you need to do the things that I show you in the video. And just like a friendly guide, each folder comes with a README file that tells you what the code is and how to use it.

I know that coding can sometimes be hard, but with this repository, you can learn at your own pace and have fun while you're doing it. And if you need any help or have any questions, just let me know. I'm here to help you on your coding journey.

So, what are you waiting for? Grab a cup of chai and let's start coding!
