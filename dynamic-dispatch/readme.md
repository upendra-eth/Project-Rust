Using trait objects can also allow for dynamic dispatch, which means that the specific method to call is determined at runtime instead of at compile time. This can be useful in situations where you don't know the exact type of an object until runtime.

here's an example that demonstrates how dynamic dispatch using trait objects can be useful when you don't know the exact type of an object until runtime:


// Define a trait with a single method
trait Drawable {
    fn draw(&self);
}

// Define a struct that implements the Drawable trait
struct Circle {
    radius: f64,
}

impl Drawable for Circle {
    fn draw(&self) {
        println!("Drawing a circle with radius {}.", self.radius);
    }
}

// Define a struct that implements the Drawable trait
struct Square {
    side_length: f64,
}

impl Drawable for Square {
    fn draw(&self) {
        println!("Drawing a square with side length {}.", self.side_length);
    }
}

// Define a function that takes a trait object as an argument
fn draw_shape(shape: &dyn Drawable) {
    shape.draw();
}

fn main() {
    // Create a Circle or Square struct randomly
    let shape: Box<dyn Drawable> = if rand::random() { 
        Box::new(Circle { radius: 1.0 }) 
    } else { 
        Box::new(Square { side_length: 2.0 }) 
    };

    // Call the function with the trait object
    draw_shape(&*shape);
}

In this example, we define a Drawable trait with a single draw method, and two structs Circle and Square that implement this trait.

In main, we create a Box<dyn Drawable> trait object that could point to either a Circle or a Square struct, depending on the result of the rand::random() function. We then pass this trait object to the draw_shape function, which calls the draw method on the underlying struct to print either "Drawing a circle with radius 1.0." or "Drawing a square with side length 2.0." to the console, depending on which type the trait object points to.

Since the exact type of the object pointed to by shape isn't known until runtime, we can use dynamic dispatch with trait objects to call the appropriate method on the underlying struct. This allows us to write code that works with multiple types that implement the Drawable trait, without knowing the specific type of the object until runtime.
