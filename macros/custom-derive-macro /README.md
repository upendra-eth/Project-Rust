# Custom Derive Macro

A custom derive macro is a feature in the Rust programming language that allows developers to automatically generate implementation code for traits like Debug, Clone, and Serialize without having to write the code themselves.

In other words, instead of manually writing code to implement these traits for a particular data structure, the custom derive macro allows the programmer to generate the code automatically by simply adding a few annotations to the struct or enum definition.

This saves developers time and reduces the likelihood of errors in the implementation code. Additionally, custom derive macros can be created by developers themselves, allowing them to generate implementation code for their own traits or interfaces.
