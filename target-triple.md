# explain rust target triple

The Rust target triple is a string that describes the target platform for a Rust program or library. It consists of three parts separated by hyphens (-): {architecture}-{vendor}-{system}-{environment}.

architecture: This part describes the CPU architecture of the target system, such as x86_64, arm, mips, powerpc, and others.
vendor: This part specifies the name of the organization or company that provides the hardware or operating system for the target system, such as apple, pc, unknown, and others.

system: This part specifies the name of the operating system or kernel used on the target system, such as linux, android, windows, darwin (macOS and iOS), freebsd, and others.

environment: This part describes the ABI (Application Binary Interface) used on the target system, such as gnu (GNU C Library), eabi (Embedded Application Binary Interface), msvc (Microsoft Visual C++), and others.

Here are some examples of Rust target triples:

x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
aarch64-apple-darwin
i686-pc-windows-msvc

wasm32-unknown-unknown

The Rust target triple is used by the Rust compiler and other tools like cargo and rustup to determine how to generate machine code for a specific target platform. By specifying a target triple, you can cross-compile Rust code to run on different architectures, operating systems, and environments without having to switch between development machines.
 
 thank you

environment

Let me try to clarify further.

An ABI (Application Binary Interface) is a low-level interface between software components, such as between the operating system and user-space applications or between libraries and applications. It defines how function calls and data exchanges should be performed between these components.
Different operating systems, architectures, and libraries may have different ABIs, which means that code compiled for one ABI may not be compatible with code compiled for another ABI. That's why the environment part of the Rust target triple is important. It specifies the ABI that Rust code should use when interacting with other software components on the target system.
For example, on Linux systems, there are different C libraries that implement the system calls and other low-level functions needed by user-space applications. The most common C library on Linux is the GNU C Library (glibc), but there are also alternatives like the musl C library. These libraries have different ABIs, which means that Rust code compiled for glibc may not be compatible with musl, and vice versa. That's why the environment part of the Rust target triple specifies which C library should be used when compiling Rust code for a specific target system.
Similarly, on Windows systems, the Microsoft Visual C++ runtime library is used as the standard C library. Rust code compiled for Windows may need to use the msvc environment part to ensure compatibility with the Windows ABI.
I hope this explanation helps clarify the role of the environment part in the Rust target triple.
