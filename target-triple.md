# explain rust target triple

The Rust target triple is a string that describes the target platform for a Rust program or library. It consists of three parts separated by hyphens (-): {architecture}-{vendor}-{system}-{environment}.

architecture: This part describes the CPU architecture of the target system, such as x86_64, arm, mips, powerpc, and others.
vendor: This part specifies the name of the organization or company that provides the hardware or operating system for the target system, such as apple, pc, unknown, and others.

system: This part specifies the name of the operating system or kernel used on the target system, such as linux, android, windows, darwin (macOS and iOS), freebsd, and others.

environment: This part describes the ABI (Application Binary Interface) used on the target system, such as gnu (GNU C Library), eabi (Embedded Application Binary Interface), msvc (Microsoft Visual C++), and others.

Here are some examples of Rust target triples:

x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
aarch64-apple-darwin
i686-pc-windows-msvc
wasm32-unknown-unknown

The Rust target triple is used by the Rust compiler and other tools like cargo and rustup to determine how to generate machine code for a specific target platform. By specifying a target triple, you can cross-compile Rust code to run on different architectures, operating systems, and environments without having to switch between development machines.
