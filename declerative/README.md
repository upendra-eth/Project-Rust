# Declarative macros

Declarative macros are a feature in the Rust programming language that allows developers to define code templates that can be reused across different parts of a program.

With declarative macros, developers can define a pattern that will be matched against the code at compile time, and then generate code based on that pattern. These macros are called "declarative" because they declare the structure of the code that they will generate, rather than specifying exactly what the code should do.

For example, a developer might define a macro that takes an input parameter and generates a function that applies a mathematical operation to that parameter. This macro can then be reused throughout the program, allowing the developer to avoid duplicating code and increasing the maintainability of their codebase.

Declarative macros can be very powerful when used correctly, but they can also be difficult to understand and maintain. As a result, it's important for developers to use them judiciously and document them clearly so that other developers can understand how they work.








macro_rules! multiply_by_two {
    ($x:expr) => ($x * 2);
}
In this example, we're defining a macro called multiply_by_two. This macro takes an expression as an input parameter, and then generates code that multiplies that expression by 2.

Here's an example of how we might use this macro:

csharp
Copy code
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = multiply_by_two!(x);
    println!("{}", y); // Output: 10
}
In this code, we're using the multiply_by_two macro to generate code that multiplies the value of x by 2. The result of this multiplication is then assigned to the variable y, which is printed to the console.
